# MusicOrganization

This is just a simple app I'm developing primarily for my own use.

The plan is to import information about the music I (or any other user) have listened to and registered at last.fm. Using this data, I'll categorize the music according to some parameters, and then be able to browse it all, and look for what I might want to listen to.

The other major feature I've planned for it, is the option to ask for a recommendation. By using the aforementioned parameters, you will enter in what kind of music you'd like to listen to, and the app will give you a recommendation.

Very much a work in progress at this point.

This application is not meant to be commercialized in any way, it's just an educational, fun project for myself. 

In this app I'm using:
